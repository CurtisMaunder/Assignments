Design notes -- 

I decided against a paged menu for the customer because most of the functions revolve around the accounts themselves
 so it simply made sense to just dynamically generate the ids and such from the account list anyway
 
The background process runs every hour, this sacrifices precision for database ease and can be easily adjusted when load changes
